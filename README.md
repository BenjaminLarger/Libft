# Libft

Libft is a foundational project in the 42 curriculum, aiming to recreate a standard C library. This project helps you understand the inner workings of common C library functions and enhances your skills in C programming.

## Overview

Libft is a comprehensive library of functions that includes string manipulation, memory management, linked list operations, and more. By building this library from scratch, you gain a deep understanding of how these essential functions work under the hood.

## Features

- **String Functions:** Implement functions such as `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strdup`, and more to handle strings.
- **Memory Functions:** Create functions like `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, and `ft_bzero` for efficient memory management.
- **Linked List Functions:** Develop linked list operations including `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd`, and `ft_lstiter`.
- **Utility Functions:** Additional utility functions like `ft_atoi`, `ft_itoa`, `ft_putchar_fd`, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with Libft, clone the repository and compile the library using the provided Makefile:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenjaminLarger/libft.git
cd libft
make
